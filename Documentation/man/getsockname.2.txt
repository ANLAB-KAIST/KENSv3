GETSOCKNAME(2)                           Linux Programmer's Manual                           GETSOCKNAME(2)

NAME
       getsockname - get socket name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int getsockname(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *restrict addr,
                       socklen_t *restrict addrlen);

DESCRIPTION
       getsockname() returns the current address to which the socket sockfd is bound, in the buffer pointed
       to by addr.  The addrlen argument should be initialized to indicate the amount of space  (in  bytes)
       pointed to by addr.  On return it contains the actual size of the socket address.

       The  returned  address  is truncated if the buffer provided is too small; in this case, addrlen will
       return a value greater than was supplied to the call.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  The argument sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT The addr argument points to memory not in a valid part of the process address space.

       EINVAL addrlen is invalid (e.g., is negative).

       ENOBUFS
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD (getsockname() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       For background on the socklen_t type, see accept(2).
