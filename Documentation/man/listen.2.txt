LISTEN(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                                LISTEN(2)

NAME
       listen - listen for connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

DESCRIPTION
       listen()  marks the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will
       be used to accept incoming connection requests using accept(2).

       The sockfd argument is a file descriptor that refers to a socket of type  SOCK_STREAM  or  SOCK_SEQ‐
       PACKET.

       The backlog argument defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for sockfd
       may grow.  If a connection request arrives when the queue is full, the client may receive  an  error
       with  an  indication of ECONNREFUSED or, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the re‐
       quest may be ignored so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EADDRINUSE
              Another socket is already listening on the same port.

       EADDRINUSE
              (Internet domain sockets) The socket referred to by sockfd had not previously been  bound  to
              an  address  and, upon attempting to bind it to an ephemeral port, it was determined that all
              port numbers in the ephemeral port range  are  currently  in  use.   See  the  discussion  of
              /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range in ip(7).

       EBADF  The argument sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The socket is not of a type that supports the listen() operation.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD (listen() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       To accept connections, the following steps are performed:

           1.  A socket is created with socket(2).

           2.  The  socket  is  bound  to  a local address using bind(2), so that other sockets may be con‐
               nect(2)ed to it.

           3.  A willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incoming connections  are
               specified with listen().

           4.  Connections are accepted with accept(2).

       The  behavior  of  the backlog argument on TCP sockets changed with Linux 2.2.  Now it specifies the
       queue length for completely established sockets waiting to be accepted, instead of the number of in‐
       complete connection requests.  The maximum length of the queue for incomplete sockets can be set us‐
       ing /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog.  When syncookies are enabled there is no logical maximum
       length and this setting is ignored.  See tcp(7) for more information.

       If  the  backlog  argument  is  greater  than  the value in /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is
       silently capped to that value.  Since Linux 5.4, the default in this file is 4096; in  earlier  ker‐
       nels, the default value is 128.  In kernels before 2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAX‐
       CONN, with the value 128.
